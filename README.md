# PHP: Silent Data Loss When Processing Arrays with Missing Keys

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP array processing where the absence of an expected key leads to data loss without any explicit error or warning. This can be especially problematic when dealing with external data sources or user input.

## The Bug

The `processData` function iterates through an array of associative arrays, expecting each to contain a `'value'` key.  If a key is missing, the code proceeds without raising any errors, effectively dropping the missing data. 

## The Solution

The solution involves robust error handling. Instead of silently ignoring missing keys, explicitly check for their existence and handle the case appropriately (e.g., logging, using a default value, or throwing an exception).
